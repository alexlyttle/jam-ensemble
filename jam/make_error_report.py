TODO:
This file generates a report of failed targets and the reason why they failed.
It then produces a new pbjam input csv containing all the failed targets
if a rerun is required -> or the user chooses which failures they wish to
rerun and which to discard. It could also give advice on dealing with 
certain exceptions (e.g. expanding the prior through bw_fac).
